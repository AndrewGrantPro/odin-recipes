            <li>6 large egg yolks</li>
            <li>1/2 cup sugar</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons molasses</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon cinnamon</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon ground ginger</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon allspice</li>
            <li>1/4 teaspoon nutmeg</li>
            <li>1/4 teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
            <li>16 ounces mascarpone cheese, softened</li>
            <li>2 1/2 cups whipping cream, divided</li>
            <li>2 (7.05 ounce) packages crisp ladyfingers, such as Vincenzovo® brand</li>
            <li>3 cups strong brewed coffee, cooled</li>
            <li>1 to 2 gingersnap cookies, for garnish</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Gather all ingredients. </li>
            <li>Fill a large saucepan with a few inches of water. Bring to a boil over medium heat. 
                Place a bowl or a double boiler insert on top of the saucepan (it should not touch the water). 
                Add egg yolks and sugar to the double boiler. Whisk until mixture is smooth and the sugar is dissolved, 
                4 to 5 minutes.
            </li>
            <li>Remove from the heat. Mix in molasses, cinnamon, ginger, cloves, allspice, nutmeg, salt, and vanilla.</li>
            <li>Transfer mixture to a bowl if using a double boiler insert, cover, and put into the refrigerator to cool completely, about 25 minutes.</li>
            <li>Beat mascarpone cheese into the egg yolk mixture with an electric mixer on medium until smooth.</li>
            <li>Whip 2 cups of cream to stiff peaks with clean beaters in a separate bowl. Fold whipped cream into the mascarpone mixture. Set aside.</li>
            <li>Dunk one third (about 16) of the ladyfingers, one at a time, into the coffee and line the bottom of a 9x13-inch baking dish with them. Cut the 
                ladyfingers, if needed, to fill the dish in an even layer. Top ladyfingers with 2 cups mascarpone mixture, spreading evenly.</li>
            <li>Repeat with another layer of soaked ladyfingers and mascarpone mixture. Top with the remaining ladyfingers for three layers of ladyfingers in total (you won’t use up all the coffee).</li>
            <li>
                <p>Top ladyfingers with 2 cups mascarpone filling, leaving about 1 1/2 cups mixture remaining.</p>
                <p>Whip the remaining 1/2 cup whipped cream to stiff peaks and fold into the remaining mascarpone mixture. Spread mixture over the top and chill for at least 4 hours or overnight.</p>
            </li>
            <li>Finely crush gingersnaps in a plastic bag. Transfer to a fine mesh sieve and sprinkle over tiramisu.</li>
        </ol>
